# Recurrent-Neural-Networks

This repository contains hands-on projects and experiments using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, GRU, and sequence-to-sequence models for different tasks.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Used

All models use the **IMDB movie review dataset** available in `keras.datasets`:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
